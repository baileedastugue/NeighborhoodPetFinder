# Project 2
Friendly Neighborhood Pet Finder

### Overview
The Coronavirus lockdown has resulted in stories of [people looking to adopt pets](https://news.yahoo.com/animal-shelters-say-in-coronavirus-lockdown-people-are-looking-for-new-friends-220330111.html).  The Friendly Neighborhood Pet Finder is designed with this need in mind, where customers are able to enter some basic contact information, what type of pet they are looking for, and let the Friendly Neighborhood Pet Finder help them find a suitable pet match.   Separately, this project has afforded the team members the opportunity to develop skills in team-based code development and testing with the NodeJS NPM packages: [ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint), [Chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai), [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha), [Mocha-http](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars), [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier), [sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize), [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars); and deploying thru [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/).  Finally, this app makes significant use of the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/).
